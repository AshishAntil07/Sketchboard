A sketchboard that can be used to make wonders. It's basically a clone of google jamboard.

You can see it [HERE](https://ashishantil07.github.io).

__Note that the deployment on Heroku will not show up, that's why you are requested to visit the deployment on github pages...__

*Recommended: Set your browser zoom to 90% and reload the sketchboard, for better experience.*
